Subset the genotype matrices to each respective cross: A, C, and E. Ensure that all markers represented in A are also represented in C, all represented in C are also represented in E, and so on (3-way inner join). Use R/qtl2's est\_map() function to re-estimate the genetic map for each cross. Taking the genetic map for each cross, use R/LPMerge to create a single consensus map. This can be used for QTL mapping with all 6 founders, as opposed to assuming a constant rate of recombination.
